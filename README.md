\* *Created by the aforementioned authors for a course project for Topics in Reinforcement Learning, IIITH, Spring 2022* \*

The final project report containing the intuitions and mathematics behind the algorithms, as well as all the results, is attached as `Report.pdf` in the repository. The approaches used are:
- Iterative mean estimation
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- Kernel Density Estimation
- Deep Q-learning
- Actor-critic algorithms
